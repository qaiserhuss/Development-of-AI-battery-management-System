# Development-of-AI-battery-management-System
This is the project which is based on the prediction of Remaining Useful Life of the battery. RUL is the metrics through which we can predict the lifespan of battery in future, how many cycles are remaining in the battery before the EOL (End of Life) of battery.

The dataset is publically available NASA dataset that is choosen to perform the experiments. 

The preprocessing file contain the preprocessing of the features for the model and there are two seperate files which are the GPR and Conv_LSTM model.
